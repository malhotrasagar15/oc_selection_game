This application will install the following python libraries:

pandas
pillow
PyQt5
PyMuPDF


# How to run the application

1. Download the folder from Google Drive 
2. Open a terminal.
3. Navigate to the directory where the script run_oc_reviewer.sh is located using the cd command:

cd /path/to/script

4. Run the script by typing:

./run_oc_reviewer.sh


# How to use the application

1. Running the app for the first time

    a) Please choose the option "No" when asked about resuming a previous sesssion
    b) Enter your name and click "ok". This will be used to collate all the results (assignments) from a single user. Default: "user_1"
    c) A window appears showing the plot on the left with buttons for user input on the right. 
        Note: The first plot will not have the optimal scaling for the display however, this gets corrected after the user clicks "Next".
    d) Please assign one quality label to the fit to the observed CMD of the cluster and provide comments (optional) in the comment box 
    e) Click "Next" or "Previous" to navigate through the plots.
    f) Click "Close Session" if necessary. The assignments are saved after each review in a file named {user_name}_oc_review_{session_number}.csv

2. Resuming a Session

    a) To resume a previous session, click "Yes" when asked about resuming a session.
    b) A window appears prompting the user to select the file corresponding to the session they would like to resume. To reiterate, each session's
        results are saved as {user_name}_oc_review_{session_number}.csv
    c) The session picks up from where the user left. In case all clusters have a quality label assigned, the app starts from the first cluster

3. Users can choose to display the name of the cluster by checking the checkbox "Show Cluster Name"


# Meaning of the Quality Labels:

Very good: Isochrone fit (cluster parameters) good enough for mass-ratios of individual cluster members
Good: Isochrone fit (cluster parameters) good but NOT for mass-ratios
Acceptable: Some cluster parameters seem a bit off but the overall isochrone fit is acceptable
Poor: Poor Isochrone Fit
